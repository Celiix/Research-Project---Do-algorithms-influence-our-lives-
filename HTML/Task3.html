      <p>Above is a power point from a online survey I created to ask indivisuals is they think that their identity as a
        person is tied to algorithms. The results for these series of questions are then showcased into a variety of pie
        charts that compares indivisual responses. The surpising results indicate that majority of the students don't
        believe that their identity are intertwine. It shows that people still believe themselves to be true with little
        to no influence. On the other hand of the results a small percentage of student believe that it maybe a part of
        who they are. The overall tone from this online survey say that their idenities do not relate to algorithms,
        this could help reinforce or make it more difficult for algorithms to eventually become them in some way,
        whether it contributes in a signifcant and small method</p>
