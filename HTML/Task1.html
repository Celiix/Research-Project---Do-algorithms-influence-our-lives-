          <h1>Task 1</h1>

          <p>
            For task 1, I conducted a study focus group with some UCEN students to further asked about how does
            algorithms affect us? The UCEN students within this audio processes general knowledge about the topic of
            computing itself. By cultivating this research could give a perspectuve on how some indivisuals feel about
            algorithms, espically if this would be to affect them both in a positive or negative way.
          </p>

          <h3>Here are the questions asked during the study focus group</h3>

          <details>
            <summary>Task 1 Questions Here</summary>
            <p>

              1. In your own words, what do you think algorithms is?<br>

              2. What influence and impact does it provide in our current society?<br>

              3. Do you feel like you're in control of your devices? every ad, video or pop-up that appears on your
              screens?<br>

              4. Continuing from the previous question, do you think algorithms are beneficial?<br>

              5. Do know what the Rabbit Hole Effect is? <br>

              6. Do you now feel vulnerable or used?<br>

              7. Can you give any examples of where you've felt influenced or urged to buy or look at certain things on
              your devices?<br>

              8. Have you previously talked or mentioned about this certain item with your phone present?<br>

              9. With this realization, what is your perspective of social algorithms?<br>

              10. Do you think algorithms affect us?
            </p>

            Gathering the responses from the study focus group, it presents to be that the participants seemed to have
            some positive and negative connotations towards this theme and the affects it has for them. As one student
            mentioned about the benefits of having algorithm, like having access to majority of things or making their
            lives more comfortable, they see that it can help aid them in certain circumstances but also at the same
            time there is a sense of vulnerability. Normalising the feeling and lack of controls by having your device
            'decide' or 'suggest' things for you can evidently make you feel unprotected and unaware of the activites
            that may occur without your knowledge. Despite knowing the fact that this affect us, we still pursue knowing
            the risk it can cause us. To conclude my finding and to answer this task 1 question, yes, we know how
            algorithms can affect us, whether it is to our advantage or disadvantage. We knowingly are aware of how this
            can affect us but we still take the risk to follow algorithms nor do we question it as nowadays computing,
            social media and the web is now a necessity that we cannot live without.
