      <h1>Task 2</h1>

      <p>If links do not work, please go back to the Homepage!</p>

      <p>For task 2, I conducted interviews with different age groups to see their perspective if they think we depend
        on algorithms or it is too controlling. Each age group gave a different viewpoint on the question. </p>

      <p> Age group 5 - 10 ~ As expected, before the interview I assumed that they would not know anything about
        algorithms or the topic itself, so I simplifed the question in a way for them to understand. The results shows
        their notiable naivety but clear link to the question. Due to the younger generation and their access to the
        internet, they wont realise this concept and think it is normal which could be concerning because the algorithm
        may already controlling them and thus influencing them to be more dependent on the algorithm then their choices.
      </p>

      <p> Age group 11 - 18 ~ This age group were more self aware of this question, due to them againg around the height
        or beginning of the algorithm hype. As the interviewees were more self aware to this, they hold some tone of
        negativity knowing the effects that algorithms can have on a indivisual. This now shows some flaws of the
        algorithms on how being too dependent and having lack of control could be impactful on a impressionable person.
      </p>

      <p> Age group 19 - 35 ~ The last age group for this interview had shown unexpected results as they were more
        worried about how with algorithms there is an attachment of scams that come along with it. This displays how
        cautious people have to be when this topic arises, by algorithms having these sort of assocations and invasive
        behaviours makes the question of it being too dependent may cause a worry. </p>
