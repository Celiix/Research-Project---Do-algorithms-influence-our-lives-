  <h2>What is algorithms?</h2>
        <p>Algorithm is a defined procedure utilized for solving a problem or executing a computation. It acts as a precise set of instructions that carry out specific actions step by step in hardware- or software-based routines.</p>

          <p>Algorithms are extensively used in various areas of IT. In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm generally refers to a small procedure that solves recurring problems. Algorithms serve as specifications for processing data and play a critical role in automated systems.</p>
          
         <p> An algorithm can be employed for sorting sets of numbers or for more complex tasks such as suggesting user content on social media. Typically, algorithms begin with initial input and instructions that detail a particular computation. Once the computation is executed, the process generates an output.
          
          There are numerous types of algorithms, each designed to achieve various goals. For instance, algorithms can perform the following:</p>
          
          <p>- Search engine algorithm, which takes search strings of keywords and operators as input, scans its linked database for relevant webpages, and provides results.<br>
          - Encryption algorithm, which transforms data according to specified actions to safeguard it.<br>
          - Greedy algorithm, which solves optimization problems by finding the locally optimal solution, hoping it is the optimal solution at the global level. However, it does not guarantee the most optimal solution.<br>
          - Recursive algorithm, which solves a problem by repeatedly calling itself until it finds a solution.<br>
          - Backtracking algorithm, which finds a solution to a given problem incrementally and solves it one piece at a time.<br>
          - Divide-and-conquer algorithm, which is divided into two parts. One part divides a problem into smaller subproblems. The second part solves these problems and combines them to produce a solution.<br>
          - Dynamic programming algorithm, which solves problems by breaking them into subproblems, storing the results to be used for future corresponding problems.<br>
          - Brute-force algorithm, which iterates all possible solutions to a problem blindly, searching for one or more solutions to a function.<br>
          - Sorting algorithm, which reorganizes data structures based on a comparison operator used to establish a new order for data.<br>
          - Hashing algorithm, which takes data and converts it into a uniform message using hashing.<br>
          - Randomized algorithm, which reduces running times and time-based complexities and employs random elements as part of its logic.</p>
